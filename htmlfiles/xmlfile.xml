      <link>https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Categorize-Inernet-Service-Providers-Mobile-Carriers-ISP_%7E01ede00e3447481aac?source=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got a list of 1,000 internet service providers from around the world, and I need to know which ones are exclusively mobile carriers<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
- &quot;Comcast Cable&quot; is not a mobile carrier, its an ISP that provides broadband cable internet<br />
- &quot;Service Provider Corporation&quot; is a mobile carrier exclusively (AT&amp;T behind the scenes)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
- Some of the names here are not the names the carriers market themselves as, a bit of digging will be required<br />
<br />
Process:<br />
- I&#039;d suggest doing it by country, and first find the names of the big mobile carriers for that country, then figure out what they are called in this list<br />
- I&#039;ve already done this for the US, Canada and the UK, so most of their mobile carriers are excluded from this list<br />
- The countries with the largest numbers are the most important (e.g. India)<br />
<br />

      <description><![CDATA[We are looking for a mobile application to work both IOS and Android. <br />
<br />
We currently have a desktop application that has a database of people. We need a mobile app that can sync with the desktop application (bluetooth, wireless &amp; wired). <br />
<br />
The &quot;App&quot; needs to connect to a windows service on the users PC. The service will be provided by us. There will be two methods - one that returns a list of groups/teams and these will each have a list of members. The second will return a list of individual members. The members returned will all have mobile phone numbers attached. The app must be able to send an sms to the groups or individuals by the users own mobile plan. <br />
<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[We are looking for a mobile application to work both IOS and Android. <br />
<br />
We currently have a desktop application that has a database of people. We need a mobile app that can sync with the desktop application (bluetooth, wireless &amp; wired). <br />
<br />
The &quot;App&quot; needs to connect to a windows service on the users PC. The service will be provided by us. There will be two methods - one that returns a list of groups/teams and these will each have a list of members. The second will return a list of individual members. The members returned will all have mobile phone numbers attached. The app must be able to send an sms to the groups or individuals by the users own mobile plan. <br />

<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to change our current photo slider within our post.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking for a slider which shows the main feature image once you access the post&#039;s content and the ability to cycle through different photos from that point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Below our a couple of links with examples of the type of slider we are looking for:<br />

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we are having trouble with our e-commerce site. We use cashie commerce for our e-commerce which is also linked to our facebook page.&nbsp;&nbsp;The store shows fine on pc but when accessed from a mobile device...it is distorted.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#039;ve contacted cashiecommerce and they stated that there is most likely an issue As well, when accessing the store from a pc, the page shows as if its a post-with the author, date, author info and comment section visible and we would not like to have that visible if possible.<br /><br /><b>Starting On</b>: January 25, 2013<br /><b>Ending On</b>: <br /><b>Posted On</b>: January 25, 2013 12:34 UTC<br /><b>ID</b>: 202097226<br /><b>Category</b>: Web Development &gt; Ecommerce<br /><b>Skills</b>: wordpress,wp-ecommerce<br /><b>Country</b>: United States<br /><b>Hours Billed</b>: 0.00<br /><br /><a href="https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Web-alteration_%7E01498e86b3060db65a?source=rss">click to apply</a>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve just realeased a new iPhone app about figure skating (the name is PractIce): you find it on the App Store searching for &quot;practice figure skating&quot;.<br />

<br />
Beside designing the marketing strategy, we want the person to also realize the plan.<br />
Our minimum target for this app is 4.000 downloads in the next 5 months.<br />
<br />
What we will value:<br />
- previous experiences in iPhone apps marketing and sales generation<br />
- knowledge about the figure skating world<br />
- a guarantee on the minimum result your plan is going to get<br />
- skills about apps SEO in order to have our app rank 1st in the figure skating niche<br />
- web and social media marketing skills<br />
- minimum knowledge about the ice figure skating world<br />
<br />

      <description><![CDATA[Hello,<br />
<br />
I need a developer to help with the creation of an app for Android, with a possibility that it will be made for iOS as well.<br />
<br />
HTML5/CSS3 into phonegap, or appmobi is acceptable, however if you are able to create the app for both platforms by doing native code that is also fine.<br />
<br />
The app I want to create is available on the iTunes App store and pretty much records information in text form (images may also be added) to a calendar as a repository system.<br />
<br />
Will need to connect to social media platforms, as well as creating our own database for all users who download the app.<br />
<br />
You will need to complete the wire frames and create a full design in colour, but I will provide guides on what style &amp; colour palette to use.<br />
<br />
Payment will be made for certain milestones<br />
<br />
1) wire frames &amp; design<br />
2) code &amp; development<br />
3) testing (&amp; code if necessary)<br />
4) successful submission to Google Play Store<br />
<br />
I will provide full details of the necessary functions upon interviewing.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $450<br /><b>Starting On</b>: January 28, 2013<br /><b>Ending On</b>: <br /><b>Posted On</b>: January 25, 2013 12:09 UTC<br /><b>ID</b>: 202097161<br /><b>Category</b>: Software Development &gt; Mobile Apps<br /><b>Skills</b>: phonegap,html5,css3,design<br /><b>Country</b>: Australia<br /><b>Hours Billed</b>: 109.17<br /><br /><a href="https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Mobile-App-Developer_%7E01a1e59e03bd92a3db?source=rss">click to apply</a>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Android graphical themable clock widget - oDesk]]></title>
      <link>https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Android-graphical-themable-clock-widget_%7E01c12ff8b4f60bfc7d?source=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I am looking for android developers for an android clock widget project.<br />
<br />
It is highly graphical but otherwise relatively simple in functionality.<br />
<br />
Native menus, checkboxes, etc.<br />
No alarm.<br />
<br />
Please show proof of prior widget, clock, or themable work.<br />
Clock App General requirements:<br />
Will need ability to buy additional theme packs (apps) later.<br />
<br />
Designed for Jelly Bean/Android phones (may grow to iPhone, but not any time soon - Please suggest abstraction layer ideas and implementation options. )<br />
Preferably (if possible) use any new graphics technology Jelly Bean and Butter have to make the app respond quickly.<br />
<br />
Widget should be resizable. 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, and so on. I expect 99% of our clocks will be square and all perfectly centered. No need to worry about rectangles. The widget resizing may <br />
be something that Jelly Bean handles already. I don&rsquo;t know. <br />
The clock should appear reasonable even at higher resolutions (my phone is actually 1080p). 800x800px for the different clock images should suffice. If they have a tablet, then it will still&nbsp;&nbsp;look good if they go larger. Advice on the image size? Please tell me.<br />
I have no idea how the developer wants to handle the clock pieces. This is up for discussion, but my assumption is to have the backing, markers, numbers, and each of the 3 hands, all be <br />
on individual images and then layered properly by the app. As long as we make our images right, everything will center nicely. Layering these pieces should also allow turning on and off <br />
the different pieces. Even if the user wants to turn everything off and make the clock invisible, they can.<br />
I&rsquo;d like the app to protect its files and images. I do not want users to have the ability to add images/create or replace images/move or copy images/or accidentally break the app. All <br />
images should be protected from tinkering however this is possible.<br />
The app will have theme packs. Theme X, Theme Y, Theme Z, and so on, that they will be able to purchase online just like the app Each theme will have skins, different styles, or variations <br />
that fit the theme. We&rsquo;d like the themes to be located in the app, not the widget list. Shown in my presentation.<br />
Users will be able to turn on and off the: face, numbers, markers, and second hand. We will provide each layer individually for each clock. All images from us will be PNG so we can use <br />
the transparency.<br />
We&rsquo;d like to be able to streamline creating the theme packs. We need to discuss this process as soon as we need to. When we are done with a theme graphically, how long before it&rsquo;s <br />
available in the market and added to the main app. We can already assume our images will be perfect and ready to go.<br />
No calendar, no alarms, no music, or sound effects. It&rsquo;s just a clock widget for now and most phones have an alarm app built in.<br />
I&rsquo;d also like to say we have over 40 themes discussed and waiting to be created. We will have lots of little app fingers out there to grab attention and thus sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re starting out with <br />
the neon theme so we can get familiar. We will have plenty of work just with these clocks for now. I have more app ideas ready to go once we&rsquo;re sailing and have a system. Our graphics <br />
will be absolutely top notch. I&rsquo;m working with two other designers and we all bring some great talent to the table. This is not a clock widget that will be anything less than the highest <br />
quality graphics and designs.<br /><br /><b>Starting On</b>: January 25, 2013<br /><b>Ending On</b>: <br /><b>Posted On</b>: January 25, 2013 08:52 UTC<br /><b>ID</b>: 202096718<br /><b>Category</b>: Software Development &gt; Mobile Apps<br /><b>Skills</b>: graphics,android-app-development,android-sdk,android-development,english<br /><b>Country</b>: United States<br /><b>Hours Billed</b>: 0.00<br /><br /><a href="https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Android-graphical-themable-clock-widget_%7E01c12ff8b4f60bfc7d?source=rss">click to apply</a>]]></description>

      <link>https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Modelling-Animation-for-Continental-Car_%7E01873eac50cc77b9e8?source=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hi,<br />
<br />
We would like to have an experienced 3D modeller, preferably with experience in Autodesk Maya to produce a 3D model (with full texture and slight animation) and have it compatible for export to Unity 3D in .fbx format.<br />
<br />
The candidate ought to have a clear idea what are the limitations for export in .fbx format so that all textures are exported together with the 3D model into Unity 3D.<br />
<br />
The model we are looking to build is a BMW 6-series (detailed) with interior of the car (no need for too much details), with slight animation of the doors opening and closing, and the car driving into the viewport, and the car driving out of viewport. <br />
<br />
Here is an example of what we require for the 3D model/animation:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.odesk.com/leaving-odesk?ref=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253DLzqc8mdktbE" title="You are about to go to a URL outside odesk.com" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzqc8mdktbE</a><br />
<br />
The augmented reality/mobile app portion will be taken care by us. All we need is the 3D model and animation.<br />
<br />
Pls apply only if you have the relevant knowledge in the following: <br />
<br />
1) Autodesk Maya 3D Modelling, Texture &amp; Animation<br />
2) Export from Maya to Unity 3D in .fbx format<br />
3) Able to communicate well verbally &amp; written in English <br />
4) Able to reply to all messages and respond promptly (within a day)<br />
5) Communicate via Skype/ Basecamp (we will provide)<br />
<br />
For all who apply, please provide the following in your reply: <br />
1) 3D work portfolio (priority given to those who have done car models before)<br />
2) Your estimated rates for the job scope provided above<br />
3) Your time frame needed for scope mentioned<br />
<br />
***Please begin with &#039;CAR&#039; in your title or we will not be entertaining spam mails. All candidates who have a strong portfolio can be looking at a steady stream of 3D projects over the next 1 year.<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon. Good luck.<br /><br /><b>Starting On</b>: January 29, 2013<br /><b>Ending On</b>: <br /><b>Posted On</b>: January 25, 2013 08:31 UTC<br /><b>ID</b>: 202096669<br /><b>Category</b>: Design & Multimedia &gt; 3D Modeling & CAD<br /><b>Skills</b>: 3d-animation,3d-modeling,english,autodesk-maya,adobe-photoshop<br /><b>Country</b>: Singapore<br /><b>Hours Billed</b>: 0.00<br /><br /><a href="https://www.odesk.com/jobs/Modelling-Animation-for-Continental-Car_%7E01873eac50cc77b9e8?source=rss">click to apply</a>]]></description>
